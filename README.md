Library Management System

This software was created to help librarians keep track of books. Users can search and borrow all available books, then return books to the library. Librarians can add, update, delete and search users and books.

Project Scope 

Features 

1. Borrowing management: In this feature, users can search available books and borrow one of them. The user can be borrowing only one book and keep the book for a maximum of one month. Also can extend an additional one more mount.  
2. Admin Panel: This feature will allow splitting Users and librarian accesses.
3. Book management: Easy to keep track of which books are on which shelf of which cabinet.
4. Statistical information: Keeping statistics of top readers, top authors and book types.

End users 

Librarians and users are the primary end-user of the beauty salon management system. Librarians will use the system to add, update, delete and search users and books. Also, can add new shelves for new books. The system will help the librarian to manage the library's daily operations. 
Users will use the system to check the available books, borrow, extend return time and return books.

Integration of the End users with the project (user stories) 

As a librarian, I want to be able to easily manage my whole books in the library and want to know who borrows which book.
As a user, I want to be able to easily reach all the books in the library and be able to see the available book for borrow. Also, I want to have some information about the book like authors, publisher, and page numbers.

A Library management system will cover the following areas: 
1. Borrowing management: System tracking all borrowed books. If a book is borrowed longer than one mount and the user doesn’t extend borrowing time, the user must pay 1$ book penalty for each day. This is helping to reduce losing books quantity. 
2. Reporting: The system can generate statistical information on the most read readers, the most read authors and book types. With this feature, the library may not award a prize to the reader who reads the most books.

Project Users, Actors, Vendors, Actuators 

1. Project users/Beneficiaries 
•Librarian: The primary user of the project is the librarian who needs to manage books and users. 
2. Actors/Third-party Companies 
•Software development companies: Software development companies can provide expertise and support for developing the project, as well as providing software tools, frameworks, and libraries. 
3. Vendors 
•Hardware vendors: Hardware vendors can provide equipment and devices necessary to run the project, such as servers, routers, and switches. 
•Software vendors: Software vendors can provide software components that integrate with the project, such as database management systems, content management systems, and customer relationship management software. 
4. Actuators 
•Servers: The servers are responsible for running the software components of the project and managing data. 
•Databases: The databases store data related to book information, user information and other relevant data. 
•APIs: The APIs enable communication between the various components of the project, such as the front-end interface and the back-end server. 

Project Properties
 
•	Functionality: The system should have the necessary functionality to manage various aspects of the library, including adding, deleting, editing books and users also borrow and return books. 
•	Usability: The system should be user-friendly and easy to navigate for librarians and users. 
•	Security: The system should be secure and protect sensitive data, including customer information, financial data, and inventory data. 
•	Scalability: The system should be scalable and able to handle an increasing number of users and books as the archive grows. 
•	Performance: The system should be fast and responsive. 
•	Integration: The system should be able to integrate with third-party services and tools, such as REST. 
•	Accessibility: The system should be accessible to users. 
•	Maintenance: The system should be easy to maintain and update, with regular backups and security patches. 
•	Cost-effectiveness: The system should be FREE!


Here are some platforms and software applications that could be used when developing a Library management system: 

Front-end Framework: Graphics User Interface in C# 
REST API
ADO 
Back-end Framework: .NET Framework 4.7.2 
Database Management System: MySQL
